# ETL Data Pipeline

**Project Context**
The main dataset being used contains academic scores for student athletes on NCAA Division 1 teams. The granularity of the data is at the school, sport, and gender level. The goal for this project is to determine if the academic scores for sports teams are correlated with the physicality of the sport. In other words, is there a correlation between contact sports and poor academic performance.

The data is extracted from 2 csv files, as well as a wiki table that was scraped.
